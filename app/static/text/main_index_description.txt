_('Over the past few years, artificial neural networks (ANN) have spread to almost all areas of industry, medicine, science etc. With the help of them, self-driving cars function. Thay can detect defects in production, pathology in x-rays. ANNs transform speech into text and vice versa, translate texts between languages, recognize/generate images and much, much more.')
_('The main goal of this web application is to demonstrate a small part of the tasks that are currently being implemented mainly with the help of the ANNs. These are computer vision tasks, in particular image recognition, semantic segmentation and object detection. For each task several neural network models is considered, most of them are very common in present day, but they are the basis on which state-of-the-art models are based.')
_('The application was created as a pet-project after the author completed several basic courses to practically consolidate the acquired skills, as well as an attempt to implement some "heavy-weighted" neural network models without using expensive hosting with graphics accelerators.')
_('For now, the application consist of three main sections, demonstrating three different computer vision tasks. You can select a specific section either from the "carousel" above, or from the navigation menu.')
_('May be some day (month, year) the application will be expanded. May be an "image captioning" section, as well as "style transfer" will be added. Still thinking about it.')
_('This web application is implemented in Python in the Flask framework. All models used here are Pytorch models, so deploying them was a real challenge.')
_('Please note that the site is hosted on a combination of free limited cloud services, so the speed of work of some models is pretty low. Thinking about optimizing it.')
